# Getting started

This document describes the steps required for using Tomino in your Unity project.

## Core components

The core components that control the game logic have no dependencies on Unity. These components include:

- `Game` - Controls the game logic by handling user input and updating the board state.
- `Board` - Contains a collection of blocks placed on the board and allows for moving them within the defined bounds.
- `Block` - A unit-sized rectangle with a specified type that the `Board` renders.
- `Piece` - A piece is a collection of blocks moving together on the `Board`.

Separating from Unity API facilitates game logic testing, as dealing with `MonoBehavior` dependencies is unnecessary.

## Creating the `Board` and the `Game`

The first step is to create a `Board`, which will define boundaries and positions for blocks and the piece controlled by the player.

```csharp
Board board = new Board(10, 20);
```

The next step is to instantiate the `Game` object responsible for controlling the main logic by handling user input and updating the board state. The game pools user input from the provided `IPlayerInput` parameter.

```csharp
var game = new Game(board, new KeyboardInput());
```

The `Game` needs to receive update events, and because it's not a `MonoBehavior`, it has to be done manually, e.g. by the parent controller class.

```csharp
class GameController: MonoBehavior
{
    void Update()
    {
        game.Update(Time.deltaTime);
    }
}
```

After configuration, you can start the `Game` using the `game.Start()` method.

## Rendering the `Board`

Both the `Game` and the `Board` represent the gameplay's current (in memory) state. These classes are separated from Unity APIs, meaning other components, such as `BoardView`, `PieceView` or `ScoreView` handle rendering.

In addition, the `BoardView` contains an instance of the `TouchInput`, which you can pass to the `Game` constructor.
